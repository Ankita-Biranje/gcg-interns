# Node Package Manager (npm)

npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, manage, and share packages (reusable code) with other developers.

## Getting Started

To start a new Node.js project, you can use the `npm init` command. This will create a `package.json` file, which is a manifest file that contains information about your project and its dependencies.

### `npm init -y`

The `-y` flag tells npm to use the default settings for the `package.json` file. This is a quick way to get started without having to answer any questions.

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Installing Dependencies

To install a package, you can use the `npm install` command, followed by the name of the package.

```bash
npm install express
```

This will download the `express` package and add it to the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file. It will also create a `node_modules` directory, where the package and its dependencies are stored.

## `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

When you install a package, you can choose to install it as a `dependency` or a `devDependency`.

- **`dependencies`**: These are packages that are required for your application to run in production. For example, `express` is a dependency because your application needs it to run.
- **`devDependencies`**: These are packages that are only needed for development and testing. For example, a testing framework like `jest` or a code linter like `eslint` would be a `devDependency`.

To install a package as a `devDependency`, you can use the `--save-dev` flag.

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

## `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm when you install a package. It records the exact version of each package that is installed, as well as the versions of its dependencies. This ensures that everyone who works on the project has the same version of the packages, which helps to avoid bugs and inconsistencies.

## Scripts

The `scripts` section of your `package.json` file allows you to define custom commands that you can run with `npm run`.

For example, you can define a `start` script to start your application:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
```

Then, you can run the following command to start your application:

```bash
npm start
```
